# MeltCurveGlobal
Matlab code for global fits to melt curves at different concentrations, also considering volume errors
Meltfit_cv_218.m does file wrangling and some initial analysis and calls AbsfitwE_cv_2018.
AbsfitwE_cv_2018.m does the optimization of thermodynamic, optical, and volumetric variables as a global fit to Abs vs T data at two dsDNA concentrations with ssDNA references.
